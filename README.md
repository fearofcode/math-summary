Math summary
------------

I've been reviewing old math books I read in college and I felt it would be useful to write down key formulas.

How to read this
----------------

First you need to [install a LaTeX distribution](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html), then you need to convert it into a suitable format, like PDF. E.g., from my command line I can do the following:

    latex math-summary.tex; dvipdf math-summary.dvi; open math-summary.pdf

Also, many of the LaTeX distributions have utilities to do this all at once. [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/), for instance, comes with a program called TeXWorks that has a Ctrl-T shortcut that runs pdfLaTeX and generates your index for you. It works well as long as you're OK with a simple text editor.

Errata
------

I'm not all that good at math so there are probably errors. Feel free to open issues/pull requests if you find them.
