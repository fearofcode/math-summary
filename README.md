Math summary
------------

I've been reviewing old math books I read in college and I felt it would be useful to write down key formulas.

How to read this
----------------

First you need to [install a LaTeX distribution](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html), then you need to convert it into a suitable format, like PDF. E.g., from my command line I can do the following:

    latex math-summary.tex; dvipdf math-summary.dvi; open math-summary.pdf

Errata
------

I'm not all that good math so there are probably errors. Feel free to open issues/pull requests if you find them.
